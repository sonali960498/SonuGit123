    "Functins abstract the underlying implementation details,allowing you to focus on what the function does rather than how it does it.This enhances code clarity and reduces complexity.\n",

    "Function: A function is a block of code that perfoms a specific task or set of tasks.It encapsulates a sequence of statements and it can have input parameters and an optinal return value. A function consists of the def statement and the code in its def clause.\n",
    "Function call: A function call is the action of executing a specific function in a program.When you call the function,you are telling the program to run the code inside that function and potentially pass arguments to it if the function takes any parameters. A function call is what moves the program execution into the function call evaluates to the function's return value."

    "except clause - The purpose of the except clause is to handle the exceptions that were raised within the corresponding try block. when an exception occurs, python checks if there is an appropriate except block that can handle the specific exception type raised.If a matching except block is found,the code inside that block is executed to handle the exception gracefully. This allows you to handle errors,perform cleanup actions,or take necessary actions to recover from the exceptional situation without crashing the program."
